# Papechan

She's my attempt to build a set of tools to manage my 10G directory of images are potential wallpapers.

She's intended to do a multiple of things like sorting, transforming these images into wallpapers.

## She can

- Download images from 4chan, I always get my wallpapers from 4chan's /wg/ board.

## She will

- Sort wallpapers into landscape or portrait so my autorandr script can put wallpaper based on orientation.
- Sort into light/dark by extracting color palettes
- Crop images to fit to screen ratio using smartcrop
- Upscale small images using waifu2x
